# rnbo.example.command-line
Very simple command line applications using RNBO

## parameter-get-set
This example shows how to get and set parameters in a RNBO object. Set a parameter within the application logic, see the result.

## sound-file-mixer
This example reads a generated RNBO DataRefList, loads file dependencies into memory, passes that memory to the RNBO object, then processes audio and saves the result. Generates a file `output.aif`.
